# Sign-Language
The project focuses on developing a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures used in sign language, specifically for fingerspelling. The goal is to create a system that can translate these gestures into text or speech, enabling communication between speech and hearing-impaired individuals and those who do not understand sign language.
